This repository contains the source code and materials for my **Bachelor’s Thesis (A.Y. 2024/2025)**, developed during an internal internship at the **University of Turin, Department of Computer Science**.

The thesis presents an **automatic model for distributing music royalties using blockchain technology**. The work explores how decentralized systems can improve transparency, reduce intermediaries, and streamline the royalty payout process for artists.

## Technologies Used
- **Smart Contracts**
- **Solidity programming language**
- **Ethereum blockchain**
- **Minimal web-based frontend**

## Prototype
This repository also includes the prototype developed for the thesis (**Solidity contracts + frontend**).  
The prototype is **simple and not yet feature-complete**, created for **demonstration and conceptual validation purposes**, and currently **a work in progress**, with plans to add further functionalities.
